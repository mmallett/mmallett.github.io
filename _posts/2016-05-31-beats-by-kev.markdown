My friends and I went to a Music and Lyrics hackathon at Spotify NYC and this
was what we ended up building. It's an ACNE (AngularJS Cloudant NodeJS Express)
application that generates rhyming lyric lines from a given subject. We didn't
quite get the lyric generation working, but I spent the afternoon on the UI
and I learned some good things, namely animate.css. (No I didn't draw the DJ, unfortunately)
