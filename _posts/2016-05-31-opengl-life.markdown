For a project in my Computer Graphics course, I created a spin on Conway's Game of Life. The rules are modified slightly. Instead
of squares, each cell is a triangle. The rules for evolution between generations were also
slightly modified, so that strong growth and death patterns were present. The

I visualized the game as a planet with forests rapidly spreading across its surface,
and slowly fading away as they age.
