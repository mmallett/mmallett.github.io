I've done a handful of websites as a freelance web developer. All sites I did
were from a given design, so I was actualizing a designer's mockup.

Most of the work was HTML and CSS, but there was a bit of JavaScript for
form validation and manipulating the DOM, and a bit of PHP for form validation
and sending emails. I also set up hosting and DNS records for my clients.
