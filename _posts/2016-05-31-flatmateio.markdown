MEAN stack (MongoDB Express AngularJS NodeJS) web application my team created as
the final project for Cloud Computing. We leverage Facebook and Linkedin APIs
to match users with potential roommates. The architecture is cloud-native, deployed
to Bluemix PaaS and leveraging MongoLab MongoDB as a service. Authentication
is delegated to Facebook Oauth with Node's passport.js.

My contribution was the majority of the UI and a bit of backend development.
