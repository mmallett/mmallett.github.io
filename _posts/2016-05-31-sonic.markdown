For the final project in Computer Graphics, I decided to make a game in tribute to Sonic the Hedgehog.
It plays somewhat like Temple Run, or the "tube levels" from Sonic 2. The goal of
the game is to collect enough rings to fill the bar before you reach the end of the
level.

The game is written in Java and straight OpenGL, with very small libraries to assist
with sound and textures. I borrowed some textures from Sonic GBA games, and from
Minecraft. I had a lot of fun with this project, and actually accomplished quite
a lot in a short time period (we had about 10 days to work on the project).
