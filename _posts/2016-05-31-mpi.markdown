My senior year of undergrad, I took a course in MPI (message passing interface).
It was eye-opening. It was the first time I was faced with truly challenging
programming problems, and it forced me to greatly expand my understanding of
C programming, and algorithms in general. In this class I learned, through
necessity, the importance of testing, builds, and good logging and debugging
skills.

Throughout the semester, we developed 3 major programs

### N-Queens problem
The N-Queens problem is a puzzle where you try to find placements for
n queens on an n x n chess board, such that none of the n queens are attacking
each other.

### Parallel Quicksort
Developed a quicksort algorithm that spreads the load across the school's 32
node cluster.

### Conway's Game of Life
Develop an MPI implementation of Conway's Game of Life, which is a set of
rules that generates automata by simulating "generations" of "life"
