  <p>I'm a software engineer at Google on the ChromeOS team in Mountain View.
    I recently earned a master's in computer science from Columbia University.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a student at Columbia, I've focused mainly on application and
    systems programming, with an underlying focus on security. I've taken
    courses on cloud computing, databases, graphics, systems and network
    security, and linux kernel development.
