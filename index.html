  <p>I'm currently a software engineer with IBM in the Greater New
    York City area, as well as a master's student in computer science at
    Columbia University.</p>

    <p>
    I'm a member of the Bluemix PaaS offering team
    at IBM, where I mainly do full stack web development with the
    ACNE stack (Angular.js, Cloudant, Node.js, Express), but I've also done
    a lot of development with Ruby (Sinatra apps) and PostgreSQL. Some other
    roles I've taken on in my time here include intern team leader and mentor,
    go to guy for CSS and UI questions, devops/continuous deployment pipeline
    builder, git expert, and agile aficionado.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a student at Columbia, I've focused mainly on application and
    systems programming, with an underlying focus on security. I've taken
    courses on cloud computing, databases, graphics, systems and network
    security, and linux kernel development.
